# David Shaw's Portfolio [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/01fdb6e7-c0fd-4404-b71c-7eb77c13e802/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/david-shaw-portfolio/deploys) ![badmath](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

  ## About/Description

  David's weather dashboard allows a user to search by a city.  The city value is passed into the openweather geo finder api to find the latitude and longitude of the city.  It then passes those values into the openweather forecast api where it loads the city name, current temp, wind speed, humidity, and UV index with a color dot for the user to read.  It will display the next five days in cards below for the user as well.  It uses local storage to create buttons for the user to click and search for that information again.
